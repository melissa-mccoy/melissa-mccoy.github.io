          <h1>My Learning Style</h1>
			   <h2>June 1, 2014</h2>
           <div id="text">
              <img src="images/LearningStyle.png" />
               <p>My learning style is a fairly mixed bag with scores of 40+ for both Concrete Sequential and Abstract Sequential and 30+ for Concrete Random but only 5 for Abstract Random.</p>
               
               <h3>Me and Sequential Thought</h3>
               <p>I definitely love process. Chemical engineers (ChemE's) are often referred to as process engineers because ChemE's design, optimize, and maintain a great majority of the world's manufacturing processes and systems. Whenever I see or approach a problem, I am always thinking how the solution can be "processized" and thus replicated without fail in the future. My job after college as a business consultant was really focused on business operations and I loved designing and optimizing business processes that made the company tick better. I  find comfort in the reproducablility and reliability of step-by-step processes that follow logic and order and apply this mentality to all parts of my life.</p>

               <p>In terms of my learning style, I've always taken a highly processized approach to how I learn. The usual process is read material, take notes, and practice concepts through exercises - you can add lectures in there but it's more like icing that I don't find very useful as I find books more comprehensive. Notably, I find it difficult at times to deviate from this method. For example, it bothers me to start doing exercises when I haven't primed myself with reading or notes as we've been asked to do in Phase 0. I like being comfortable enough with the material when approaching exercises that I don't need notes (it's like a test of what I've just learned). I love reading books cover to cover and have a nasty itch if I skip something or skim sections.</p> 

               <h3>I guess I've got some Random in me</h3>
               <p>So I was pretty high in Concrete Random and I see things within this label that definitely describe my past behavior. I much prefer working and solving problems independently or at least need signficant "work alone" time between collaborating with a group.  I also feel that I work better with competition (though I guess who doesn't?). I like experimenting to find answers but I need to know the underlying principles that make one trial correct while another incorrect - if I don't know the "why" behind a behavior, then I won't be able to extrapolate this behavior out logically. In terms of how I organize information in my mind, I am always creating hierarchies in my mind, which I guess is kind of a hybrid of linear and chunk organization?</p>
               
               <h3>So I'm apparently not Abstract Random?</h3>
               <p>I definitely agree that this label describes me in the least. But there are some things that stick out here that do align with me: I much prefer listening in a conversation than talking; I like having community and participating in group activities; and I find the task of establishing/maintaing health relationships invigorating. </p>
