          <h1>My Favorite Websites</h1>
			   <h2>May 17, 2014</h2>
         <div id="text">

            <p><span class="bullet">Amazon.com</span><br />When did my love affair with Amazon begin? I believe it was freshman year of college, when I was discovering many new things, and this handsome, confident, attractively geek-ish web service bummed into my email inbox: Amazon Prime. Everything that I could ever want or need was now made available to me within 2 business days absolutely free. It had every quality I looked for in an e commerce platform and I've been faithful ever since. </p>
            <p>Amazon.com's homepage has a clean, friendly, personalized, organized, and inviting quality to it, which aligns with what the company's service. Taking a more critical approach, I might say the homepage is rather "busy" with many product suggestions and ads scattered about. But given most people immediately go to the search bar upon entering the site, I believe the homepage space, under the navigation header, is less about helping you navigate the website and more about catching your attention with something you'd like to buy which makes "business" understandable.</p>
            
            <p><span class="bullet">Pandora.com</span><br />While Pandora is more of a web app rather than the kind of website that the assignment questions refer to, I couldn't leave it out. Pandora first exposed me to music outside of radio and adeptly curated my interest in music. The website's layout is exception with a fixed header of control buttons (play, pause, etc) and a "quick reference" section at the bottom that describes the artist and the song. I find this bottom section extremely useful, as I don't have to take time to google the artist and ultimately get distracted, and I can view a further description without stopping the music. I would say the interface is cool, clean, informative, and easy-to-navigate. </p>

            <p><span class="bullet">FareCompare.com</span><br />In my past life, I booked a lot of international flights and farecompare.com as my go-to service. It excelled in including more airlines than any other travel site (eg some budget airlines are not listed on Kayak, etc) and in providing a plethora of filtering options. In terms of interface, the homepage focus it's "above the fold" space on an app-like area where you can type your desired flight details - this is perfect. In terms of feel, it has a somewhat bland complexion and I supposed I'd describe it as basic, functional, and professional.</p>
