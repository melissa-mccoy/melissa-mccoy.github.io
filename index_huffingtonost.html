          <p>Hi there!
            My name is Melissa (if you couldn't tell from above) and I love everything sweet (if you couldn't tell from below). My past experience rests in heavy industries like energy/mining/manufacturing as a chemical engineer and business consultant. I've also started some entrepreneurial endeavors focused on water infrastructure and 3D Printing. Look forward to meeting in the fall!Hi there!
