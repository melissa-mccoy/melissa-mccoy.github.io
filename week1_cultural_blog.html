            <h1>First Take on DBC Culture</h1>
  			   <h2>May 17, 2014</h2>
           <div id="text">
             <p>As a first caveat: the first question asked during Karim's Fireside Chat definitely hit home for me - going down rabbit holes. I spent a lot of time on Rabbit Holes this week and while it was enjoable and educational, I found myself short on time when it got to the end of the week (and submitting the very last blog post of the group haha). Let's just say I'm Neo in this regard and will improve on this in future.<br/><br/>But onto the actual discussion of DBC's culture: I am in the camp of fearing not necessarily that I won't keep up, but that I will kill myself in the process. I have a tendency of neglecting my health/sleep/etc when focusing on a goal. The humanness, kindness, and guenuiness that I have felt from DBC's staff and students has comforted me on many levels and I am discovering that DBC is much more of a community that I expected it to be. And I am increasingly excited about being a part of it!<br/><br/>The emphasis on peer and collaborative learning is new for me and I am excited about practicing learning in this way as I believe it's much of how one learn's in the workplace, in any career. All through school and even in my college engineering classes, I was very much a "lone" learner - I read the textbook on my own and worked with TA's and professors with questions, but never once engaged in a study group. Working as a business consultant over the past 1.5yrs, I've found that learning from peers and in auditory rather than a reading manner is essential to success. <br/><br/>I promise that I have much more profound things to say and am able to say them in a much more organized manner, but I will have to bid everyone goodnight with it being 6am until I can edit this in the morning.
