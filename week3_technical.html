          <h1>Why is JavaScript so popular?</h1>
			   <h2>June 1, 2014</h2>
         <div id="text">

            <h3>#10. JavaScript is Easy to Learn</h3>
            <p>In years past JavaScript was often seen as a clumsy language most closely associated with annoying internet popups and browser incompatibility issues. Some people still shudder at the very mention of “JavaScript”.</p>

            <h3>#9. JavaScript is Easy to Edit</h3>
            <p>JavaScript is very easy to get started with because you don’t need much to do so. JavaScript is a scripting programming language so the code you write does not need to be compiled and as such does not require a compiler or any other expensive software to write. That’s right, JavaScript is just plain text, so all you need to write it is notepad or any other plain text editor. Personally, I recommend notepad++, as it has all the bells and whistles you want (syntax highlighting, advanced search features, tabs) without any of the overhead of larger programs like Adobe’s Dream Weaver and most importantly without a price tag since it’s completely free.</p>

            <h3>#8. JavaScript is a Prototyping Language</h3>
            <p>In a prototyping language every object is an instance of a class. What that means is that objects can be defined and developed on the fly to suit a particular use, rather than having to build out specific classes to handle a specific need. This opens the door for very rapid and flexible development as well as a wide array of possible design patterns that would not be possible in more structured languages. The ability to prototype also allows seamless extension of existing classes, even built in ones.</p>

            <h3>#7. There are Lots of Available Tools</h3>
            <p>JavaScript is interpreted by the browser and over time (most) browsers have adapted to giving power users enough freedom to look under the hood and see or even change the JavaScript that’s running behind your favorite sites. Pressing F12 on most browsers will open the console which can let you talk directly to the JavaScript and explore it from a top down perspective. In addition to this, many talented developers have created their own publicly available and free tools that make working with JavaScript even easier.</p>

            <h3>#6. JavaScript is Easy to Debug</h3>
            <p>Using these tools makes it very easy to debug your JavaScript too. Any error you run into can be traced back to the exact place it occurred in the browser console or in FireBug. You can place breakpoints in the page code in order to debug the code using traditional methodologies, or simply unit test the bits in the console until the part that isn’t working becomes happily apparent.</p>

            <h3>#5. JavaScript Allows for object oriented design</h3>
            <p>While JavaScript is probably not the first language that comes to mind when talking about O.O.P. (object oriented programming), it is absolutely able to make use of Object Oriented Design Patterns and principles. Using JavaScript you can easily create objects and use special OOP design patterns. Unlike more structured languages, however, JavaScript does not force you to use OOP, which can be advantageous for smaller projects.</p>

            <h3>#4. JavaScript is Easily Extensible (jQuery, Prototype, Dojo)</h3>
            <p>JavaScript alone is a very fast and powerful language. It can do extremely complex things behind the scenes or manipulate aesthetics on web pages in ways you wouldn’t believe. Still, some of these manipulations are difficult to design and construct. They require a lot of code and time to develop. To this end, developers have written several very good libraries to support the language and allow it to easily manipulate web pages with just a few lines of code.</p>


            <h3>#3. AJAX</h3>
            <p>For a long time the web was a very static place. The best we could offer was animated GIFs until Macromedia’s Flash came along and changed that. Still, for the most part, if something needed to change on a web page, the page had to be reloaded. Reloading a page is never pretty, either aesthetically or from a data management standpoint, so it was with open arms that the web development community welcomed the inclusion of XMLHttpRequest in browsers around the turn of the century.</p>

            <h3>#2. JavaScript is a Natural fit for the Web</h3>
            <p>JavaScript may have had humble beginnings, but has grown astronomically over the last decade in scope and application. It is fully supported by all modern browsers and works seamlessly with HTML/DHTML, CSS3 and background services via AJAX. Take a look at its growing popularity compared to other popular languages.</p>

            <h3>#1. Node.js</h3>
            <p>Perhaps the most limiting thing about JavaScript is that it only works on the front end. That is, it’s perfect for manipulating web pages, creating User Interfaces and fetching data from the server via AJAX, but in order to fetch that data it still has to rely on other technologies such as PHP or .Net to run on the server and serve that information up. With Node.js this is slowly starting to change. Node.js is built on Google Chrome’s JavaScript Runtime engine called V8. When Google was writing the code for their now well known browser Chrome, they had to rethink how JavaScript would be evaluated and what the best and and most efficient way of handling modern JavaScript would be. Unlike Internet Explorer or even Firefox, Google had the advantage of starting fresh while already being aware of some of the pitfalls in developing a browser.</p>
