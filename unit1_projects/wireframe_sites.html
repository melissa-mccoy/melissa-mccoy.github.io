	<h2>Amazon.com</h2>
	<p>The website is solving people's problem of having accessing to a wide market of goods at low prices and short shipping times. Given there are so many types of products that a user could be looking for when entering the site, it is difficult to cater the homepage to each user's needs.</p>

	<h2>Pandora.com</h2>
	<p>The website is solving people's problem of accessing free music and identifying/finding new music that aligns with their preferences. The process of finding new music for the user is a black box process and thus the site must depends on their song selection alone, hooking the user on the first few songs provided, in order to win the users trust/prove to the user that the site can provide he or she with music he or she likes.</p>

	<h2>FareCompare.com</h2>
	<p>The website is solving people's problem of browsing all possible flight choices across the globe - most travel search engines fail when you fly across country borders. There is a challenge of showing the user the flights he or she most desired when there are 1000+ options given the user's initial search criteria.</p>
